# Tic-Tac-Toe

My Educational Repository

Hello there! ,
              Akshay, Somit and I are fellow Freshmen/Class-Mates at IIT Bhubaneswar. We are assigned a Project by our Professors to design a program in the Game Development Field using C-Language. As Beginners, we are persuaded to use code built by others, for which we thank @sanfoundry for letting us review their code and to morph it into our own.Yet,we still implemented our own ideas and brought life to the game.We hope whoever views our project shares our opinion regarding this Project.Have a Good Day.
