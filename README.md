# Tic-Tac-Toe

My Educational Repository

Hello there! ,
              I am a Freshman at  IIT Bhubaneswar. I was assigned a Project by my Professors to develop Code in the Game Development Field using C language. As a Beginner, I was persuaded to use code built by others, for which I thank @sanfoundry for letting me review their code and morph it into my own. Yet, I still implemented my ideas and brought life to the game. I hope whoever views my project shares the same opinion. Also, feel free to provide any suggestions regarding this Project in the Comment section.

            Have a Good Day.
