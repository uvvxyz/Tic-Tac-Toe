# Tic-Tac-Toe

My Educational Repository

Hello there! , Akshay, Somit, Surya and I are fellow Freshmen/Batch-Mates at IIT BBS. We are assigned a Project by our Professors to design a program in the development field using C-Language. As Beginners, we are persuaded to use code built by others. We thank @sanfoundry for letting us review their code and morph it into our own.
